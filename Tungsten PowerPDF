Hi Michal, 

We are still working on this. Progress is we are  able to embed the license into the setup file. Currently performing local tests.

Also, from  the Kofax network installation documentation , https://docshield.tungstenautomation.com/PowerPDF/en_US/5.1.0-cyu29ubkgp/print/KofaxPowerPDFNetworkInstallationGuide_EN.pdf

Therefore, we have to target computers instead of users in the AD group: hii_o365_Tungsten_PowerPDF 

Hi Michal,

We are still working on this. The current progress is that we have successfully embedded the license into the setup file and are now performing local testing.

Additionally, based on the Kofax Network Installation documentation
(https://docshield.tungstenautomation.com/PowerPDF/en_US/5.1.0-cyu29ubkgp/print/KofaxPowerPDFNetworkInstallationGuide_EN.pdf
),
the client installation must be executed with administrative privileges and requires a per-computer installation context (ALLUSERS=1).

Because of this requirement, we will need to target computer objects rather than users in the AD group hii_o365_Tungsten_PowerPDF.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Hi all,
(++ @Sonnappa, Hombegowda, he will take over the coordination for the package)

So, took them some time to deliver the key... The serial number for us is as follows: AV09Z-K13-TVGD-C7DV-J8

However, as we have received a company-wide key, we need to use another installer. The new installer and the latest patch is available in this folder:  Tungsten Power-PDF  The main installer is in the folder "KofaxPowerPDF.....", whereas the patch is in folder "TungstenPowerPDF....5.1.1"

Here are some configurations we should set during the installation:
•	Username: SAM@Harman.com
•	Company name: Harman International Industries
•	"Launch Create Assistant at Startup" -> NO
•	"Create shortcut for Kofax to Desktop" -> Yes
•	"Set Kofax as the Default application for PDF" -> NO (Adobe Reader should still be the default PDF app for all)

We have an AD group "hii_o365_Tungsten_PowerPDF" which we can use for deploying the package to the users after testing. Currently, the group only holds two users, we will populate it with all eligible users in the next days.

Thanks and regards,
Nils
